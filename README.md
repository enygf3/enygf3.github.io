If you want to see this site paste "enygf3.github.io" into your browser address bar. The site have a problem with scroll - 
when you are clicking on item in navbar all works fine, yes?
No! If i clicked for example on 3 item third block will get class "active" and you will see third block. BUT. The scroll will start on first block instead of third and i dont know
how to fix it. If you know how to fix this problem, please make pull request.
This site is my first experience with block-scrolling
P.S mobile version isn't done yet.
